# MicroVerse-Demo

This demo requires MicroVerse, MicroVerse-Splines, and MicroVerse-Vegetation to be installed, and shows off how those assets can be used to build a high quality environment. 

While the project is setup in Unity2021 on the Built in Render Pipeline, the shaders are written with BetterShaders and will compile in HDRP and URP as well. 

The assets used in this project are taken from Unity's Terrain Rendering, Book of the Dead, and the Fontainebleau, and covered by the Unity Companion License.
