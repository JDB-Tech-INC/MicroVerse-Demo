# MicroVerse-Demo

This demo requires MicroVerse, MicroVerse-Splines, and MicroVerse-Vegetation, and MicroVerse-Ambiance to be installed, and shows off how those assets can be used to build a high quality environment. 

While the project is setup in Unity2021 on the Built in Render Pipeline and uses the post processing package, the shaders are written with BetterShaders and will compile in HDRP 2021.3 and URP 2021.3 as well, and you can delete or replace the post processing object with the one for your specific render pipeline.

The assets used in this project are taken from Unity's Terrain Rendering, Book of the Dead, and the Fontainebleau, and covered by the Unity Companion License.
